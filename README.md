While browsing the Rails docs, I ran into the snippet `--new` that you can add when generating a new Rails project.
This project is simply to test what this snippet gets you and how Rails builds the project.
This was about a 120 second api spinup.. pretty cool

`
rails new bookstore --api
`

`
rails g scaffold book title:string body:text
`

`
gem "rack-cors"
`
